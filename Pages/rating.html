						<td>MATH 2130</td>
						<td>
							One of the more complicated math classes I've taken due to many rules to know by name, 
							but after a bit it all clicked and started making a lot of sense. Great with communication 
							and will take the time to answer any questions students have about the content if they ask.
						</td>

					<tr>
						<td>Chris Smith</td>
						<td>Professor</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>1.5</td>
						<td>ENGL 2135</td>
						<td>
							His class was rather easy however you needed to make sure to read the long book he makes 
							you buy as each week requires a discussion post on the 70ish page chapter.
						</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Zheni Utic</td>
						<td>Professor</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>STAT 1401</td>
						<td>
							Majority of the grade for the class was based on tests but those weren't too bad. 
							Solid professor overall and answered questions fairly thoroughly.
						</td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
						<td>Hao Zhang</td>
						<td>Professor</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>IT 1130</td>
						<td>
							Tests are a solid mix of multiple choice and open response questions. Notes can go by very 
							quickly and he doesn't post them online anywhere, so be sure to pay attention in class. 
							If you have a question and he can't figure it out first try then he isn't much more helpful 
							after that.
