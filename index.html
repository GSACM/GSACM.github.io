              On certain Saturdays, join us on our discord server where we have form teams and group collaborators together!
              There will be plenty of time to plan out your sprints with your team, learn needed frameworks and libraries, and bring your projects to life.

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p><strong>Sprint-Based Development:</strong> Each metting for the event will be a single sprint-time over the course of which you and your teamates can plan what you will acomplish in the 
              following hours and following sprints.</p>
            <p><strong>Form A Team:</strong> Come with your best ideas for an innovative project and invite members to join you, or join an already created team witha project you find interesting!</p>
            <p><strong>Learn And Build:</strong> No matter what skill level you are at, this event is a great chance to learn something new from your peers in a friendly and productive enviornment.</p>
            <p><strong>Show Your Work:</strong> After the final sprint of the hackathon, all groups will gather to show off their team's creations, a great chance to demonstrate what you have learned and
            accomplished during the event.</p>

            <p>If you are ready to learn new skills, take your current skills to the next level, and bring your innovative ideas to life - join the ACM x TDA discord or contact any admin of either group and ask how to join!</p>
